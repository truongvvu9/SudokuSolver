# SudokuSolver
A sudoku solver web application that can solve any sudoku puzzle.

A simple website I built to provide a GUI for my Sudoku Solver application. You enter the sudoku board on each cell and if there is an empty cell, you put a '.' without the quotes in place of the empty cell. After you finished entering the sudoku board, you click 'Solve' and it will solve the entire sudoku puzzle within a second. This application can also detect if you entered the sudoku board correctly by checking for any repeating numbers in the same column, row, or box and checking if you entered a valid character for each cell. You can try out the application here: https://sudokusolver10101.000webhostapp.com/
